# MBP Fan Control

Controls the fan speed based off the current temperature of your machine.

With the use of systemd, this script executes every minute to ensure the fan speed properly represents the temperature.

This script was developed and tested on a MacBook Pro Retina, running Arch Linux. Feel free to tweak it for your system.
